# Todo-app
Hi, I'm pavan, this was my first project after a few weeks of JavaScript training. I hope this project will help you in some or the other ways.
Instructions 

Clone the Repo

$git clone https://github.com/pavankpdev/Todo-app.git

That's it your ready to go, no other frameworks are used here. It's pure javascript.

If this helps please star the repository or if you think there's an issue please do pull a request, or if you think this can be optimized please fork the repo and make a contribution.
Thank You.

UPDATE

Version 2 is released 

What's New in version 2
-> Local Storage is enabled, now the ToDo's will not disappear when the page is refreshed, you can get your ToDo whenever you run the app.
-> Enhanced UI (psst :- I've only changed the image, that's it ^o^ )
